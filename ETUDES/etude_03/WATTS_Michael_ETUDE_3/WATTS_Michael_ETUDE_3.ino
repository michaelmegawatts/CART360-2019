/********************** ETUDE 3 CART 360 2019 *******************************
 * WELCOME! 
 * THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO DESIGN A VERY SIMPLE KEYBOARD (5 KEYS)
 * WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY LIVE, RECORD, AND PLAYBACK SINGLE NOTES (NO CHORDS). 
 * THERE WILL BE A BUTTON WHICH WHEN PRESSED WILL TAKE THE USER TO THE NEXT MODE:
 * THERE ARE 5 POSSIBLE MODES
 * 0 ==  reset    ==   led off == also resets
 * 1 ==  live     ==   led BLUE
 * 2 ==  record   ==   led RED
 * 3 ==  play     ==   led GREEN
 * 4 ==  loopMODE ==   led PURPLE
 * 
 * ADDITIONALLY - WHEN THE USER CHANGES MODE, 
 * THE RGB LED WILL CHANGE COLOR (ACCORDING TO THE SPECIFICATIONS)

 * PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE COMMENTS:
 * DO NOT ADD ANY MORE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS 
 * ONLY IMPLEMENT THE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS SUPPLIED
 * THERE IS NO NEED TO ADD ANY NEW VARIABLES OR CONSTANTS
 * PROVIDE COMMENTS FOR ANY OF THE CODE IMPLEMENTED
 * GOOD LUCK!
 * 
 * ELIO - HERE IS THE PARAGRAPH REQUESTED. IT'S STILL KIND OF A MYSTERY TO ME.
 * 
 * First we define all the Buttons, LEDs, the notes, their durations, functions, which pins they are all 
 * connected to, and set up an array for the notes to be played live, recorded and played back once established. 
 * Then the pinMode is set up to send the signal to the Arduino. Next, the loop is set up by defining the chooseMode, 
 * setRGB, and selectMode functions. chooseMode allows you to change modes and assign the notes to each button and 
 * corresponding LED. These notes will vary depending on the resistors used on the Arduino and personal selection. 
 * Each LED needs to be set up through the setRGB function using “if” statements that will trigger the pin connected 
 * to the correct color. Once this is set up reset function is used to make chosen notes unavailable. Then the notes 
 * in the array that are assigned to each button are written in the live, record, play, and loopMode functions so 
 * that they can continuously run. 
 *

/**** CONSTANTS ********************************************************/

#define BUTTON_MODE_PIN 2 // Button to change the mode

// constants for RGB LED
#define LED_PIN_R 5 // R PIN
#define LED_PIN_G 9 // G PIN
#define LED_PIN_B 6 // B PIN

// constant for note in (button-resistor ladder on breadboard)
# define NOTE_IN_PIN A0

//constant for max number of notes in array
#define MAX_NOTES 16

// a constant for duration
const int duration = 200;

// constant for pin to output for buzzer 
#define BUZZER_PIN 3 // PWM

/******** VARIABLES *****************************************************/
// counter for how many notes we have
int countNotes =0;
// array to hold the notes played (for record/play mode)
int notes [MAX_NOTES]; 
int mode =0; // start at off

/*************************************************************************/


/**********************SETUP() DO NOT CHANGE*******************************/
// Declare pin mode for the single digital input
void setup()
{
  pinMode(BUTTON_MODE_PIN, INPUT);
}

/**********************LOOP() DO NOT CHANGE *******************************
 * INSTRUCTIONS: 
 * There is NO NEED to change the loop - it establishes the flow of the program
 * We call here 3 functions repeatedly:
 * 1: chooseMode(): this function will determine the mode that your program is in 
 * based on if the button (linked to the BUTTON_MODE_PIN) was pressed
 * 2: setRGB(): will set the color of the RGB LED based on the value of the mode variable
 * 3: selectMode(): will determine which function to call based on the value of the mode variable

**************************************************************************/

{
  chooseMode();
  setRGB();

}
/******************CHOOSEMODE(): IMPLEMENT *********************************
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * Read the value from the Button (linked to the BUTTON_MODE_PIN) and 
 * if is being pressed then change the mode variable.
 * REMEMBER:
 * mode == 0 is reset 
 * mode == 1 is live
 * mode == 2 is record
 * mode == 3 is play
 * mode == 4 is loopMode
 * Every time the user presses the button, the program will go to the next mode,
 * once it reaches 4, it should go back to mode == 0. 
 * (i.e. if mode ==2 and we press, then mode ==3) ...
**************************************************************************/
void chooseMode(){
  // IMPLEMENT
}

/******************SETRGB(): IMPLEMENT *********************************
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * Depending on the value of the mode variable:
 * if the mode is 0 - RGB LED IS OFF
 * if the mode is 1 - RGB LED IS BLUE
 * if mode is 2 - RGB LED IS RED
 * if mode is 3 - RGB LED IS GREEN
 * if mode is 4 - RGB LED iS PURPLE
 * YOU MUST USE A SWITCH CASE CONSTRUCT (NOT A SERIES OF IF / ELSE STATEMENTS

/**********************SELECTMODE() DO NOT CHANGE *******************************
 * INSTRUCTIONS: 
 * There is NO NEED to change this function - it selects WHICH function should run based on the mode variable
 * There are 4 possibilities
 * 1: reset(): this function will reset any arrays etc, and will do nothing else
 * 2: live(): this function will play the corresponding notes 
 * to the user pressing the respective buttons. 
 * NOTE:: the notes played are NOT stored
 * 3: record(): this function will play the corresponding notes 
 * to the user pressing the respective buttons
 * AND will STORE up to 16 consecutive notes in an array.
 * 4: play(): this function will playback any notes stored in the array that were recorded
 * in the previous mode
 * 5: loopMode(): this function will playback any notes stored in the array that were recorded, 
 * BUT unlike the previous mode, you can choose in which sequence the notes are played.
 * REQUIRED: only play notes from the array (no live stuff)
